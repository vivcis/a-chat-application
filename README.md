# a-chat-application
This is a chat application that listens and accepts request from a server, using TCP. 
Multiple clients connects to the server and can read and write and write to it. 
It is built with concurrency in mind so that messages can be broadcasted to all the clients in the room except the client that sent the message. 
Table testing is used to ensure all functionalities are working.
